      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a second-year Computer Science student at St. Clair College with a strong interest in software development and web technologies. I enjoy building clean, functional applications and continuously improving my skills through hands-on projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have experience working with both front-end and back-end development, including responsive web design, server-side programming, and database management. I love learning new technologies and taking on challenges that help me grow as a developer.
